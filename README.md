# React person

Implement a `Person` component rendering a person's details using the given markup
and use it 3 times inside the `App` instead of static markup.

- Pass the entire person object as a prop using `<Person person={misha} />` (**do not** use individual fields);
- Omit the `age` if it is not present in the person object;
- If a man is married, refer to his partner as `wife`; if a woman is married, refer to her partner as `husband`;
- If a person is not married, display the message "I am not married";
- Ensure that the class names in `Person.jsx` match those used in `App.jsx` (`Person`, `Person__name`, `Person__age`, `Person__partner`).

**Important:** The constants `misha`, `olya`, and `alex` are valid and should not be modified. Property `age` is optional.
